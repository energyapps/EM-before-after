          <h1>Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, CO</h1>          
          <p>The Rocky Flats site is situated on a plateau at the eastern edge of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

          <p>From 1952 to 1994, the plant’s primary mission was producing nuclear and nonnuclear weapons components for the America’s nuclear arsenal. The key component produced at Rocky Flats was the plutonium pit, or “trigger,” for nuclear weapons. Most of the triggers in our nuclear weapons stockpile were manufactured at Rocky Flats.</p>

          <p>The approximately 6,500-acre plant site was extensively remediated, and is now a wildlife refuge.</p>

          <h1>Fernald Preserve, OH</h1>
          <p>The Fernald Preserve is located outside of Cincinnati, Ohio, on the site of the former Feed Materials Production Center, a uranium processing facility that produced high-purity uranium metal products as part of the United States' nuclear weapons production cycle.  The site’s production mission began in 1951 and continued until 1989.</p>

          <p>In 1989 remediation and restoration of the  1,050 acre site began and in 2006 it was completed, and now the site is a nature preserve that is open to the public. The property’s natural features were restored using native plants and grasses. Restoration activities at the site created one of the largest man-made wetlands in Ohio. The site’s varied and unique habitats are accessible on a seven mile network of trails. Over 240 species of birds have been observed, and over 100 different species have been documented as nesting at the Fernald Preserve.</p>

          <h1>Mound, OH</h1>
          <p>The Mound site in Miamisburg, Ohio, is located approximately 10 miles southwest of Dayton, Ohio, and operated from 1948 to 2003. The site was built to continue Dayton, Ohio’s Manhattan Project work on poloniumberyllium initiators used in early atomic weapons. The site expanded into an integrated research, development, and production facility supporting weapons, energy, and space missions.</p>

          <p>In 1984 remediation began on the site this work was completed in 2011. The site was remediated for industrial use, and all nuclear material has been removed and facilities were demolished. All wastes were shipped offsite and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.</p>
